# fm-saxml-id-name-maps

This project transforms FileMaker Save as XML (SaXML) files into field and table maps (CSV) using XSLT.

Having this information available can be useful for analyzing FileMaker Server TopCallStats logs. Those log files reference table and field IDs but not their names. The CSV files generated by this project can be used to enrich the TopCallStats logs, mapping the numeric IDs to their corresponding names. This makes it easier to interpret and analyze the data in the logs, providing more meaningful insights into the operations of your FileMaker server.

## Usage

```bash
./create_maps.sh /path/to/input/folder /path/to/output/folder
```

## Requirements

- ```xsltproc``` for running XSLT transformations
- Check if you already have it:

```bash
xsltproc --version
```

- macOS installation instructions:

```bash
brew install libxslt
```

## Samples

- Test drive the command using the provided sample input XML files.

```bash
./create_maps.sh samples/in samples/out
```
